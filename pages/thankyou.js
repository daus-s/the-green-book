            This project has been a far cry from the "I think I can have this ready by New Year's!"
            While I did have a prototype working it wasn't really, how do I put this, usable. 
            </p>
            <p>
            As more and more people saw the project I began to realize I couldn't cut any corners and finally have a version that you f&#x25A0;ckers can't break.<br/><br/>
            (This will most definitely be broken by Saturday night.)
            </p>
            <p>
            Throughout this project there have been a few people, now I might add; users, that were instrumental in building this project. 
            </p>
            <p>
            A big thanks go to the unofficial official Project Manager (aka rant listener) <b>Todd Carmichael</b> who would listen to my bullshit for countless hours and is now requesting features... :ICANT:            </p>
            <p>
            Another thank you goes to <b>Aiden "Magic" White</b> for the domain and reminding me that this was the original project, not some massive prediction engine and API that I got sidetracked with. One of the original members of TheGreenbook and a chill-ass roommate.
            </p>
            <p>
            <b>DA Anderson</b>, if I can build it, he will break it. My <i>de facto</i> tester to whom I would show a feature that was working entirely correctly on my machine only to see it immediately crumble as soon as it's in the hands of the user.            </p>
            <p>
            A huge thank you to everyone and best of luck with all of your bets &lt;3
            </p>
