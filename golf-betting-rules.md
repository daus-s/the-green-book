Betting on Golf tournaments (usually just the majors)

After the cut round (2nd), betters build a team ( of 4)  golfers.  Similar to drafts in Fantasy football, with alternating picks, each better selects a golfer to add to their team.

After the final round, the winner payouts are determined by the following:

* $1.00 for golf tournament winner on your team
* $0.50 for tournament second place
* $0.25 per stroke.  Each player’s score is added to the better’s team total.  The better’s team with the lowest score gets $0.25 per stroke.
